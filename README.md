  <summary>basic info</summary>
  <p>hihi my name is seven, or eden— i don't have a consistent name so i preferred just to refer me however you'd like! im an unlabelled queer thing with no prefrence, or set labels. u can try to guess my pronouns or just refer to me by it/its. u can often find me running around in ponytown as i dont have a real set spot where i sit. u can often find me either alone offtab or with my closest oomf seb!! i often can be seen lurking around the roblox/dw spot near bakery , very rarely the greek mythology area past library or up in the mountains!

  i am also a minority (which should be obvious) so pleasee if ur 18+ / -13 then shoo shoo pls ^_^...
  
  i have many many kins thats too much to name out, but my bestest kins are; 007n7 (4skn) , gary prince (f&c) , two time (4skn) , betty grof (at) , jade harley (hs) , futaba sakura (ps5) , shadow milk cookie (crk) , and nico di angelo (pjo) !!!
  i also am a copelink of elliot from forsaken :'3 </p>

  <summary>before you interact</summary>
  <p>i am VERY VERY skittish and anxious, so most of the time u see me u may need to take the warnings in my pony name with a grain of salt and interact cautiously... if im not with any oomfs then i'll likely be reluctant to speak.... i am also very rarely online but try to be active every now and then.

as far as im willing to share i have diagnosed audhd and anxiety which will likely affect the way i interact with you if i do not mask!!!!

  i may have very repetitive speech which i cannot help and tend to repeat my stims alot.... i am also very slow at processing texts so i may misread stuff or ask u 2 reword urself,, and also i cannot judge tones through text so tonetags are much appreciated. i also struggle conveying emotions or words of affirmation 3':
  
  and as ive stated before please dont interact with me if ur like a full grown adult under any circumstances or if your 13 or younger.. :'3 </p>

  <summary>interests</summary>
  <p>i LOVE LOVE clowns and insane clown posse!!!! i donot condone whatever allegations are against them (despite the may allegations being debunked) theyre simply something i find very hard to dettach myself from ... i also love love devi mccallion and her other music projects/aliases :3 
  
 i love love roblox centered media!!! my mains interests i hardly ever shut up about are roblox centered; like hackers, myths, forsaken, die of death, trud, piafos!!!, blocktales, regretevator, phighting etc. i might be called retroslop or whatever but ive been a roblox addict since 2016....
 
 other misc things i adore and indulge in are percy jackson books, adventure time and fionna & cake, sally face, kindergarten (primarily 1), greek mythology, mouthwashing (loosely), cookie run (primarily kingdom and ovenbreak), homestuck, 811, arcane, fnaf, deltarune and undertale, tadc (loosely), alien stage, and so on!!!!!</p>

  <summary>do not interact</summary>
  <p>i typically block freely but for whatever reason i still follow basic dni criteria for the sake of my sanity and that i still dont want super old or younger people interacting me.

  no proshippers/darkshippers because thats just weird....... 
  
  i also tend to avoid many fandoms or fans for various reasons, such as tcoaall, mha, idv, homestuck, hh/hb, tadc fans and so on. and no i will not elaborate as to why i dont want fans of these particular things interacting with me </p>
